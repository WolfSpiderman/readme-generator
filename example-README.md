## Description

I wanted to make writing README files feel quicker, simpler, and easier. So I made a command-line application that would make  writing READMEs feel seamless, with a series of questions/prompts. I've always found writing READMEs to be tedious, even though they really aren't difficult to write, but this will make writing all future readme files feel much easier, with editing only required to add credits, assuming no spelling, grammatical, or punctuation errors while answering the app's questions.  This was my first time creating a command-line application on my own, which was a valuable experience of itself. I also learned about- and got more practice with- importing/exporting different files, both user-made, and through node, such as with the fs and inquirer packages, which were used to write the README.md file, and ask the user the questions and record the answers/inputs, respectively. This README was made solely using the application.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you should fork the repo, and do a git clone, so that you can run the application in your terminal/command-line. You will need NodeJs installed as well.

## Usage

Once you have cloned the forked repo, and have NodeJs installed, cd to the repo in your terminal/command-line, and run node index.js. This will trigger a series of questions, starting with asking the title of the project. After the title question, answer any input questions in complete sentences. Once all prompts have been answered, the readme file will be generated using the format (ProjectName)-README.md, for easy identification, and as not to overwrite a traditionally-named README that might exist in the directory.
